## Bugs
We work hard to avoid them, but they still happen. We use GitHub issues to track bugs and ongoing work for Kubeiql.

### Known Issues
We also use GitHub issues for updates to known issues, including alerts when fixes are in progress. 

### Reporting New Issues
Before filing a new issue, check Known Issues to see if your problem already exists. When reporting a new issue, provide as much detail as possible. The more information, the easier it is to debug and the faster you'll get a fix. 

**Tips:**

* A description. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Why do you think the behavior was incorrect?
* What Kubernetes version are you running? Have you seen the same issue/behavior on other versions too?
* Anything else that seems relevant.
